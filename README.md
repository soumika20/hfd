# REACH 

R.E.A.C.H. (Rapid Emergency, Access, Care, and Help Anytime, Anywhere) is a human-centered emergency response system designed to bridge the critical gap before first responders arrive. The platform allows bystanders to report incidents through images, videos and location data while automatically generating AI-based summaries for dispatchers as well as bystanders. It also notifies nearby volunteers, provides routing to emergency services, displays weather and government alerts, and supports communication even in low-connectivity conditions.

This repository contains the complete codebase for the web application and mobile-adapted interface, including frontend components, backend integrations with Firebase, and the AI processing pipeline. The project was developed as part of the Human Factors in Design course (ED3010).
